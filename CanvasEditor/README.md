# CanvasEditor
A simple text editor with IDE functionality, using HTML5 Canvas


## Vision and next steps
This is just a proof of concept to show that HTMl canvas can be used for a simple text editor with a blking cursor and a content assist (intelliSense) window etc.
The next steps are to migrate these functions in to a class, allow multiple lines, and to line up the contentAssist window with the last word typed
